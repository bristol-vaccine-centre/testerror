\arguments{
\item{pos_obs}{a vector of the number of positive observations for each component of a panel test}

\item{n_obs}{a vector of the number of observations for each component test}

\item{false_pos_controls}{the number of positives that appeared in the component tests of a specificity
disease-free control group. These are by definition false positives. This
is (1-specificity)*n_controls (ignored if \code{spec} is given)}

\item{n_controls}{the number of controls in the specificity
disease-free control group (ignored if \code{spec} is given).}

\item{false_neg_diseased}{the number of negatives that appeared in the component tests of a sensitivity
confirmed disease group. These are by definition false negatives. This
is (1-sensitivity)*n_diseased (ignored if \code{sens} is given)}

\item{n_diseased}{the number of confirmed disease cases in the sensitivity
control group (ignored if \code{sens} is given)}

\item{...}{}

\item{sens}{the sensitivity of the component tests of test as a \code{beta_dist_list} (optional)}

\item{spec}{the specificity of the test as a \code{beta_dist_list} (optional)}

\item{samples}{number of random draws of sensitivity and specificity (optional - default 1000)}

\item{fit_beta}{return the result as a \code{beta_dist} object?}
